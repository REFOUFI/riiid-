https://www.kaggle.com/c/riiid-test-answer-prediction


 this was my first competetion

this jupyter notebook is from my first kaggle compettion , it's an lgbm model 
i  also develped, an other approach using tranformers in pytorch i  also develped 

the fair challenge in RIIID COMPETION was to implent a good piplinde for the test data , wich require a lot of software engerring , with a hidden set of testing data ,that was  good way to learn 
the first notebook(lgbm) is the model developpemnt , implemnted on my local machine (macboook )

second code is the pipeline for testing , implented directly on kaggle
